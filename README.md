# bAmazon

Welcome to bAmazon. This application has 3 parts. You can view the store either as a customer, a manager, or a supervisor. The following is a breakdown of how to use the app as each type of user.

## Customer

To log in as a customer, type the following in command line:

node bamazonCustomer.js

1. When you first log in, you will be presented with a list of all available products for sale along with their prices and department.

2. You will then be asked what you would like to purchase and given a list of items to choose from.

3. After choosing an item, you will be asked how many units you would like to buy.

4. After entering how many units you would like to buy, the purchase will be successful if there is enough stock available.

5. If there is enough stock to accommodate your purchase, you will be shown your order total and notified that you will receive an e-mail confirmation when your order ships.

6. If there is not enough stock, you will be given a message saying "Sorry! Insufficient Quantity" and then asked if you would like to purchase another item.

7. If you answer yes, you will be presented with the list of available products again and asked what you would like to purchase.

8. If you answer no, the application ends and you exit the system.
